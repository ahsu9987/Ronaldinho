        <h1>BIO-DATA:-</h1> </div>
     <p>Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as Ronaldinho Gaúcho (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁonawˈdʒĩɲu ɡaˈuʃu]) or simply
   <a href="#" class="underline">Ronaldinho</a>,[note 1] is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but was also deployed as
    a winger. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. 
    He is the only player ever to have won a World Cup, a Copa América, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa Libertadores and a 
    Ballon d'Or.[4] A global icon of the sport, Ronaldinho was renowned for his technical skills, creativity, dribbling ability and accuracy 
    from free-kicks, his use of tricks, feints, no-look passes and overhead kicks, as well as his ability to score and create goals, 
    all prominent characteristics of his early-age background playing futsal. He is known by the nickname "O Bruxo" ("The Wizard").</p>
